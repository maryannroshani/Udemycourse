# **Web UI test automation**


_Frameworks Used:_ 

`Behaviour Driven Data (BDD):`
Cucumber (Gherkin) - Writing test cases for business scenarios, Mapping step definition to feature file
Running tests with Test Runner, Integrate cucumber with TestNG and Maven 

`Data Driven Testing (DDT):`
@DataProvider
Excel Data Reader - data driving and parameterizing tests 

`Page Design Pattern (POM):`
Page Object Model and Page Factory
- Create Base and utility function 
- Organizing page objects
- Add Test Script 

`Automation Test Framework:`
TestNG - Annotations, Include, Exclude, @Test Priority, Session Handling & TestNG Dependency, Run Multiple Test Suites, TestNG Listeners in Selenium: ITestListener & ITestResult, TestNG Report Generation, Customize, PDF & Email TestNG, TestNG XML
JUnit
Converting framework into TestNG and configuring TestNG xml file 



_Technologies Used:_

`libraries:`
Selenium - Portable software testing framework for web applications.
WebDriver, Select Class, Action Class, Assertions, 

`AutoIT:` File uploading and downloading

`Web Locator Techniques and Tools:` ID, Name, CssSelector, Class Name, Xpath (Sibling, Ancestor ), Link Text

`Web Form & Element`: TextBox, Submit Button, sendkeys(), click() CheckBox and Radio Button, Image in Selenium Webdriver, DropDown, Alert & Popup Window, Web Table, Dynamic Web Tables, Desired Capabilities in Selenium WebDriver, All/Broken links, iFrames, Screenshot, Maximize Browser, Element Present, waitFor, andWait, Implicit, Explicit, & Fluent Wait, Scroll Down or UP, Select Date from DatePicker/Calendar 
`Virtual environments:`
Docker - Docker is the world’s leading software container platform. Developers use Docker to eliminate “works on my machine” problems when collaborating on code with co-workers. Operators use Docker to run and manage apps side-by-side in isolated containers to get better compute density. Enterprises use Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new feature faster, more securely and with confidence for both Linux and Windows Server apps.

`Build Tools:`
Apache Maven - Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

`Continuous Integration:`
Jenkins - Jenkins is an award-winning application that monitors executions of repeated jobs, such as building a software project or jobs run by cron.
GitHub - Importance of GitHub/GIT as version control tool.

`Reporting:`
ExtentReports - HTML reporting library for .NET and Java which is extremely easy to use and creates beautiful execution reports. It shows test and step summary, test steps and status in a toggle view for quick analysis.
Screenshot of test failures

`Editors, IDE, consoles:`
IntelliJ IDEA - A free and open-source IDE for Java, Groovy, Scala and Android development.
IntelliJ IDEA Selenium plugin - Plugin for IntelliJ Idea to simplify creation of web tests using selenium

Language:
Java OOPS
